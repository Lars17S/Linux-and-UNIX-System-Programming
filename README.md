# Linux and UNIX System Programming

This repository collects samples of code and exercises related to Linux kernel API, GNU C Library and UNIX Network Programming.
The idea is to keep track of the key concepts about network programming and understand Linux/UNIX operating system from a
low-level point of view. Thus some code-files are explained with special attention in important points such that system call
functions, definitions, and standards for operating systems (Linux/UNIX).
